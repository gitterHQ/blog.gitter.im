We built Gitter to help people who make software communicate better.

Gitter provides free public chat room for open source projects on GitHub as well as private communication channels for teams and businesses. 

With full rich text support through markdown including full syntax highlighting for code, tight integration with GitHub issues and activity as well as integrations with Trello, Jenkins, Travis and many other services, you'll never need another chat application again.
