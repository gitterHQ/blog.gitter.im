Great news. The API team at GitHub have been busy over the last few weeks and have released a whole series of new, more granular oAuth scopes. 

What this means is that we don't need to ask for **write** access to your profile in order to use Gitter. Huzah! 

For new users, just head on over to **[Gitter](https://gitter.im)** and once you click signup you'll see the new oAuth permission request.

Existing users, just [sign out](https://gitter.im/signout) and then log back in again and you'll see the change to permissions.
