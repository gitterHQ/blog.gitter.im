Today, we released badges for your chat rooms.

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter)

It's pretty simple to create your own, just reference the Gitter URL using the following syntax:
`http(s)://badges.gitter.im/owner/repo.png` 
`http(s)://badges.gitter.im/org.png`

If you want to put this in markdown on GitHub, feel free to copy, paste and adjust the code below:
`[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter)`

You can also access this from Gitter using the settings cog in any chat room and choosing "Share this chat room".
