We've just launched the ability to drag and drop files into any chat room.

During our Beta period, the file size is limited to 5MB. Once we've ironed out any teething issues, we'll look to increase that.

### How it works

Quite simply, drag a file into any chat room, you'll notice a progress bar above the chat input area as the file uploads and processes. We'll make a thumbnail out of the file if we support it (images and PDFs for now) and once the file is processed it will appear in the chat area.

Please let us know how you get along and if you experience any issues with this, please feel free to get in touch via our [Support site](http://support.gitter.im) or come and find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter).
