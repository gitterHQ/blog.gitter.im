Missed day 1 as well? Read about it [here](http://blog.gitter.im/lxjs-day-1-what-you-missed).

# Keynote: Internet of Nothings
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AAxqMVgeJy4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Jonathan Lipps](http://twitter.com/jlipps) kicks off day two with some thought provoking observations on technology's role in our lives. He begins by touching on Albert Borgmann's ideas on the device paradigm and showing the separation between mechanism and product. This separation sadly leads to knowledge being lost as the mechanism becomes more complex. He then goes into Jaron Lanier's work by showing that we are not a vector of statistics before ending his talk with a heartfelt song with some help from the audience.

# Atom.io

[Kevin Sawicki](http://twitter.com/kevinsawicki) addresses the current state of the atom editor. He shows how it uses [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) instead of node-webkit, and how even though official support for anything other than osx will be coming in a couple of weeks, 10% of all files opened have been opened in these unsupported operating systems. He covers some of the neat features of atom before getting to atoms performance focus that will carry on for the next 2-4 months. One of the big changes is that the editor is being completely rewritten in React, and this is actually available now via a flag in the settings.

# Merge Conflict: Conflict Resolution for Developers
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wdOxI7NHzCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Tracy Hinds](http://twitter.com/HackyGoLucky) covers one of the trickiest problems facing the community: conflict resolution. She shows that conflict isn't inherently bad, but using hate hurts everyone. With a nod back to [Angie's talk](http://blog.gitter.im/lxjs-day-1-what-you-missed#theartofconnection) the day before, she mentions how non verbal communication is impossible 140 characters, and this can make a conflict worse. She then gives steps on negotiating a resolution of conflict so that you can high five / hug afterwards.

# Peer-to-peer web
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QpQhR9fBNnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Feross Aboukhadijeh](http://twitter.com/feross) shows everyone the current state of peer-to-peer web support in browsers with 50-60% of the browser market supporting it. Despite this, it is currently being used by sharefest.me, talky.io, peercdn and snapchat video. He then goes into detail about how it is used in [webtorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent) and quickly demonstrates how to create a clone of Omegle using WebRTC.

# Live code your next Robot and control it from the web
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BxJ-27Nnakc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Matteo Collina](http://twitter.com/matteocollina) achieves the impossible by not only performing a successful software demo, but with some live hardware hacking as well. He starts by controlling a two line LCD over wifi using MQTT - a pub sub protocol with offline capability. He then remixes this with some buttons and LEDs to make a internet enabled voting machine.

# Hapi are the Developers
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EFSB1bjkjbI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Wyatt Preul](http://twitter.com/wpreul) shows off hapi as a web framework that looks perfect for large teams. By using deterministic routing and validating not only requests but responses as well (via joi), breaking changes can be spotted quickly. Hapi can be extended with plugins, setup quickly with json configuration and features a full suite of debugging tools. Walmart have battle tested this exciting new framework so it can handle any black friday without fuss.

# Extending DevTools for Custom Debugging
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ohF_exBsQYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
In her first time(!) out of the states, [Brittany Storoz](http://twitter.com/brittanystoroz) goes all out and live codes a custom devtool to debug an example MV* framework in under 10 mins. By creating a chrome extension, she demonstrates how you can easily see the inner workings of your app. This in turn makes debugging without knowing anything about the framework so much easier. Bonus: check out her fantastic memory of lorum ipsom.

# Invest. Amplify. Educate.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nK2og2MSUCs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
[Mike Brevoort](http://twitter.com/mbrevoort) closes the talks with some sobering facts about education; a child is 50% more likely to live beyond five if the mother can read, and in recent years college degrees in the United States have increased in cost but graduates are earning less. Education needs to change from the old-school victorian style of learning/teaching by regurgitate facts as information is no longer precious. He shows that we need to step away from waterfall education and gives some fantastic examples about what we as individuals can do. In simple terms, we need to invest in others and amplify teachers.
